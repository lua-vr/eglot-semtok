# Eglot-semtok

> Update: development is now taking place in the forms of patches to eglot.el, see https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=79374
> 
> To make it easier to test, I will be mirroring the patched eglot.el file here. If you use this file as your eglot package, semantic tokens should just work with language servers that support them.
